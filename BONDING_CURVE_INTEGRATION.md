# NadFun V2 Bonding Curve Integration

This document is for indexers, analytics, backend services, and advanced integrations that need to understand NadFun's pre-graduation bonding-curve state.

Use [ROUTER_INTEGRATION.md](ROUTER_INTEGRATION.md) for user-facing create, buy, sell, native quote, permit, and slippage-protected flows.

## Contract Role

| Contract | ABI | Use For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BondingCurve | `abi/BondingCurve.json` | pre-graduation curve state, quote math, lifecycle events, graduation indexing |

The direct `BondingCurve.buy` and `BondingCurve.sell` functions are low-level balance-delta entrypoints. They do not take user slippage or deadline params. User-facing integrations should call `NadFunRouter`.

## Addresses

```ts
export const NADFUN_V2_MAINNET_BONDING = {
  bondingCurve: "0x9f3832732923252A21044F21eE6bd87F09514ae4",
} as const;

export const NADFUN_V2_TESTNET_BONDING = {
  bondingCurve: "0x27063a38eC0D3281D354090EB92e669Ed1eB956C",
} as const;
```

Code samples below use `NADFUN_V2_TESTNET_BONDING` for illustration. Swap in `NADFUN_V2_MAINNET_BONDING` for production.

## Quote Token Configs

Mainnet and testnet WMON / LVMON quote configs share the same curve parameters. Verified via `ProtocolManager.getConfig(quoteToken)` on each network. Only `settlementThreshold` differs between networks.

```ts
export const NADFUN_V2_MAINNET_QUOTE_CONFIGS = {

Human-readable values, assuming 18 decimals:

| Field | Mainnet | Testnet |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `virtualReserve` | 70,000 quote | 70,000 quote |
| `virtualTokenReserve` | 1,060,569,000 launch | 1,060,569,000 launch |
| `minTokenReserve` | 251,660,440.677966101694915255 launch | 251,660,440.677966101694915255 launch |
| `deployFee` | 10 quote | 10 quote |
| `graduateFee` | 1,000 quote | 1,000 quote |
| `curveProtocolFeeRate` | 100 bps (1%) | 100 bps (1%) |
| `dexProtocolFeeRate` | 35 bps (0.35%) | 35 bps (0.35%) |
| `settlementThreshold` | **100 quote** | **1,000 quote** |

## Current Fee Config

NadFun V2 bonding-curve fee rates are basis points, where `10000` means 100%. Verified via `ProtocolManager` view calls on each network. Mainnet currently restricts `creatorFeeRates` to a single value (`100`); testnet allows three tiers.

```ts
export const NADFUN_V2_MAINNET_BONDING_FEES = {
  defaultCreatorFeeRate: 100,
  curveProtocolFeeRate: 100,
  creatorFeeRates: [100],
  snipingPenaltyTable: [8000, 4000, 2000, 1500, 1000, 1000, 500],
} as const;

export const NADFUN_V2_TESTNET_BONDING_FEES = {
  defaultCreatorFeeRate: 100,
  curveProtocolFeeRate: 100,
  creatorFeeRates: [100, 300, 500],
  snipingPenaltyTable: [8000, 4000, 2000, 1500, 1000, 1000, 500],
} as const;
```

| Config | Mainnet | Testnet | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `defaultCreatorFeeRate` | `100` | `100` | 1% creator fee used by default integrations |
| `curveProtocolFeeRate` | `100` | `100` | 1% protocol fee on bonding-curve buys and sells |
| `creatorFeeRates` | `[100]` | `[100, 300, 500]` | values accepted when creating a token |
| `snipingPenaltyTable` | `[8000, 4000, 2000, 1500, 1000, 1000, 500]` | same | extra buy-side fee during the first blocks after creation |

`creatorFeeRates` is governance-controlled via `ProtocolManager.setAllowedCreatorFeeRates`. Use `ProtocolManager.isCreatorFeeRateAllowed(rate)` to validate before submitting a `create` call.

Sniping penalty lookup uses `block.number - createdAtBlock` as the table index.

| Blocks Since Creation | Sniping Penalty |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | 8000 bps, 80% |
| `1` | 4000 bps, 40% |
| `2` | 2000 bps, 20% |
| `3` | 1500 bps, 15% |
| `4` | 1000 bps, 10% |
| `5` | 1000 bps, 10% |
| `6` | 500 bps, 5% |
| `>= 7` | 0 bps |

The initial buy inside token creation does not apply sniping penalty. Normal buys after creation apply the current sniping penalty, plus creator and protocol fees. Sells do not apply sniping penalty.

### Quote Freshness

Pre-graduation buy quotes are block-sensitive while sniping penalty is active. Within the first 7 blocks after `createdAtBlock`, the buy-side fee can change every block.

Recommended:

- Do not cache pre-graduation buy quotes during the first 7 blocks.
- Re-read `getAmountOut` / `getAmountIn` immediately before transaction construction.
- Use short deadlines and tight `amountOutMin` / `amountInMax` bounds.
- Sells and post-penalty buys are not block-sensitive in the same way.

## Reading Live Fees

The constants above are defaults from `ProtocolManager.getConfig(quoteToken)`. Live per-pair rates are stored in `FeeCollector` and can drift from those defaults via governance calls to `setCurveProtocolFeeRate`. `BondingCurve._calculateFees` reads from `FeeCollector.getFeeConfig(curve.pair)`, so off-chain quote replication must read the same source — not the `ProtocolManager` defaults — to match on-chain math.

`pair` comes from `BondingCurve.getCurve(token).pair`. See [DEX_INTEGRATION.md#read-fee-config](DEX_INTEGRATION.md#read-fee-config) for the `getFeeConfig` call shape.

### Field Order

`FeeCollector.getFeeConfig` returns **5 fields in this exact order**:

```text
(baseToken, quoteToken, creatorFeeRate, curveProtocolFeeRate, dexProtocolFeeRate)
```

Bonding curve integrators use 4 of them: `baseToken`, `quoteToken`, `creatorFeeRate` (3rd), `curveProtocolFeeRate` (4th). The 5th field (`dexProtocolFeeRate`) is DEX-only — skip it. Clients that decode positionally must read `curveProtocolFeeRate` as the **4th** field, not the 5th; pulling the 5th field as the curve protocol rate silently understates the curve fee by ~65 bps per trade.

Symmetric warning for DEX integrators (who use the 5th field, not the 4th) is in [DEX_INTEGRATION.md#read-fee-config](DEX_INTEGRATION.md#read-fee-config).

### Cache Invalidation

Bonding-curve-relevant `FeeConfig` field mutability:

| Field | Mutability | Update Event |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `baseToken` | immutable after `Setup` | none |
| `quoteToken` | immutable after `Setup` | none |
| `creatorFeeRate` | immutable after `Setup` | none |
| `curveProtocolFeeRate` | mutable | `CurveProtocolFeeRateUpdate(pair, oldRate, newRate)` |

If you cache `getFeeConfig(pair)` for off-chain bonding-curve quote math:

- Populate the cache on `FeeCollector.Setup(baseToken, pair, ...)`.
- Refresh `curveProtocolFeeRate` on `CurveProtocolFeeRateUpdate`.
- `baseToken`, `quoteToken`, and `creatorFeeRate` never change after `Setup`, so a single read is enough.
- `DexProtocolFeeRateUpdate` is DEX-only; ignore for bonding caches.

## Lifecycle

1. Token creation initializes a curve with virtual reserves from the selected quote config.
2. Optional initial buy runs against the curve during creation.
3. Before graduation, buys and sells update virtual reserves and emit curve events.
4. The curve graduates when `virtualTokenReserve == minTokenReserve`.
5. On graduation, the protocol pays the graduate fee, sends remaining quote/token liquidity to the LP manager, seeds the DEX pair, and emits `Graduate`.

## Curve State

Read curve state with `getCurve(token)`.

```ts
import BondingCurveAbi from "./abi/BondingCurve.json";

const curve = await publicClient.readContract({
  address: NADFUN_V2_TESTNET_BONDING.bondingCurve,
  abi: BondingCurveAbi,
  functionName: "getCurve",
  args: [token],
});
```

Important fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `token` | launched token address; zero address means no curve |
| `creator` | creator recorded at token creation |
| `quoteToken` | quote token used for the curve |
| `virtualQuoteReserve` | quote-side virtual reserve |
| `virtualTokenReserve` | token-side virtual reserve |
| `k` | constant product invariant |
| `minTokenReserve` | graduation boundary |
| `createdAtBlock` | block used for sniping-penalty lookup |
| `graduated` | true after DEX liquidity handoff |
| `creatorFeeRate` | creator fee in bps |
| `dexType` | DEX type recorded for post-graduation pair |
| `pair` | NadFunPair address |
| `graduateFee` | quote amount paid on graduation |

## Graduation Race Conditions

A token can graduate between quote time and execution time. Direct integrations against `BondingCurve` (or against the post-graduation `NadFunPair`) must handle the lifecycle boundary themselves.

- For user-facing trades, prefer `NadFunRouter`. It checks lifecycle internally and routes the quote and execution to the correct venue.
- For direct integrators, check `getCurve(token).graduated` (or `NadFunRouter.isGraduated(token)`) close to execution time.
- Treat pre-graduation quotes near the `minTokenReserve` boundary as short-lived; the next buy can graduate the curve.
- Re-simulate before sending the transaction if the quote is more than a few blocks old.

`BondingCurve.getAmountOut` / `getAmountIn` revert after graduation; `NadFunPair.getAmountOut` / `getAmountIn` revert before graduation. Catch reverts and re-quote on the other venue if needed.

## Quote Helpers

`BondingCurve.getAmountOut` and `getAmountIn` are pre-graduation only. They revert after graduation.

```ts
const amountOut = await publicClient.readContract({
  address: NADFUN_V2_TESTNET_BONDING.bondingCurve,
  abi: BondingCurveAbi,
  functionName: "getAmountOut",
  args: [token, amountIn, true],
});

const amountIn = await publicClient.readContract({
  address: NADFUN_V2_TESTNET_BONDING.bondingCurve,
  abi: BondingCurveAbi,
  functionName: "getAmountIn",
  args: [token, amountOut, true],
});
```

`isBuy = true` means quote token in, launched token out.

`isBuy = false` means launched token in, quote token out.

## Curve Math

The V2 bonding curve uses constant product math:

```text
k = virtualQuoteReserve * virtualTokenReserve
```

Underlying amount formulas:

```text
amountOut = reserveOut - ceil(k / (reserveIn + amountIn))
amountIn = ceil(k / (reserveOut - amountOut)) - reserveIn
```

Buy path, `isBuy = true`:

```text
snipingFeeRate = getSnipingPenalty(token)
protocolFeeRate = curveProtocolFeeRate
totalFeeRate = snipingFeeRate + protocolFeeRate + creatorFeeRate
quoteInAfterFees = amountIn - ceil(amountIn * totalFeeRate / BPS)
tokenOut = virtualTokenReserve - ceil(k / (virtualQuoteReserve + quoteInAfterFees))
tokenOut is capped at virtualTokenReserve - minTokenReserve
```

Sell path, `isBuy = false`:

```text
protocolFeeRate = curveProtocolFeeRate
totalFeeRate = protocolFeeRate + creatorFeeRate
quoteOutBeforeFees = virtualQuoteReserve - ceil(k / (virtualTokenReserve + tokenIn))
quoteOutAfterFees = quoteOutBeforeFees - ceil(quoteOutBeforeFees * totalFeeRate / BPS)
```

The initial buy during token creation does not apply the sniping penalty. Normal post-create buys can include a sniping penalty based on `createdAtBlock`.

## Fees

Bonding-curve fees are quote-token-denominated.

| Fee | Applies To | Current Value (Mainnet & Testnet) | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| deploy fee | token creation | 10 quote token | quote config |
| graduate fee | graduation | 1,000 quote token | quote config |
| curve protocol fee | pre-graduation buys and sells | 100 bps, 1% | quote config |
| creator fee | pre-graduation buys and sells | default 100 bps, 1% | create param |
| sniping penalty | normal buys during early blocks | 8000 -> 4000 -> 2000 -> 1500 -> 1000 -> 1000 -> 500 bps, then 0 | protocol sniping schedule |

Read the live sniping penalty:

```ts
const penaltyBps = await publicClient.readContract({
  address: NADFUN_V2_TESTNET_BONDING.bondingCurve,
  abi: BondingCurveAbi,
  functionName: "getSnipingPenalty",
  args: [token],
});
```

## Events

Index these events for bonding-curve state.

| Event | Use For |
| --- | --- |
| `Create` | token discovery, pair discovery, metadata, initial curve parameters |
| `Buy` | pre-graduation buy feed |
| `Sell` | pre-graduation sell feed |
| `Sync` | real and virtual reserve tracking |
| `SnipingPenalty` | early-buy penalty accounting |
| `Graduate` | DEX liquidity handoff |

Example `Create` watcher:

```ts
publicClient.watchContractEvent({
  address: NADFUN_V2_TESTNET_BONDING.bondingCurve,
  abi: BondingCurveAbi,
  eventName: "Create",
  onLogs: logs => {
    for (const log of logs) {
      const {
        creator,
        token,
        pair,
        quoteToken,
        name,
        symbol,
        tokenURI,
        virtualQuoteReserve,
        virtualTokenReserve,
        minTokenReserve,
      } = log.args;

      console.log({
        creator,
        token,
        pair,
        quoteToken,
        name,
        symbol,
        tokenURI,
        virtualQuoteReserve,
        virtualTokenReserve,
        minTokenReserve,
      });
    }
  },
});
```

## Vault Allocations

Vault allocations are configured at creation time and control how creator fees are distributed.

```ts
export const NADFUN_V2_MAINNET_VAULTS = {
  burnVault: "0x94CFAA4d41AE2336E2a4D8B307c7faf906384C27",
  lpVault: "0xA1A5ea7c9490A25E715351Ddc66A7771e1817e66",
  creatorFeeVault: "0x687f9172D5F4798694811333C5C5696afCF4F6f4",
  giftVault: "0xa46A28558D77B1bF9dd98A451f78c43bE2545605",
  dividendVault: "0xD6858E770aE97dF74B86BD5CddCd1Dd5D0c34BFC",
} as const;

export const NADFUN_V2_TESTNET_VAULTS = {
  burnVault: "0xFA707fe7d2c2894bf0436c7B73947cBA9E888017",
  lpVault: "0x2acD9C75fe16c909237D9e6f080210D26c8c956D",
  creatorFeeVault: "0xfEB12B7698e296C57BBF9f0c9b38B3e908285A99",
  giftVault: "0xC112EB5C40FC9A22425300D232A31d00FF840ad0",
  dividendVault: "0x3c90Dd4D78bD84aF7099D0ec34eFbbcA4e69ed2F",
} as const;
```

Rules:

- `vaults.length` must be between 1 and 5.
- `bps` total must equal `10000`.
- each `bps` must be greater than 0.
- duplicate vault addresses are rejected.
- each vault must be active in the protocol vault registry.

Vaults:

| Vault | Behavior | `setupData` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `burnVault` | uses creator fees for buyback and burn | `"0x"` |
| `lpVault` | uses creator fees for liquidity and LP burn | `"0x"` |
| `creatorFeeVault` | lets creator claim accumulated quote token | `abi.encode(address recipient)` |
| `giftVault` | makes fees claimable by GitHub/X identity | `abi.encode(GiftTarget{platform, id})` |
| `dividendVault` | splits creator fees into dividend tokens (bot-converted) and distributes to holders via Merkle claim | `abi.encode(address[] dividendTokens, uint16[] ratios, uint256 minBalance)` |

`dividendVault.setupData` rules:

- `dividendTokens.length` must be between 1 and 10, with no duplicates.
- each token must be one of the supported categories below.
- `ratios` is per-token basis points (`uint16`); each must be greater than 0 and the total must equal `10000`.
- `minBalance` is the minimum source-token balance a holder must hold to claim a dividend.

A dividend token is accepted when it is any of:

- a quote token (WMON or LVMON);
- a registered nad.fun V2 token;
- a graduated nad.fun V1 token;
- an allowlisted token from the curated list below.

Allowlisted dividend tokens (managed on-chain via `DividendVault.setAllowedDividendToken`):

| Symbol | Mainnet | Testnet |
| --- | --- | --- |
| USDC | `0x754704Bc059F8C67012fEd69BC8A327a5aafb603` | `0xe7046ecd03426cC22Cd298E4aBccB5086977E01B` |
| USDT | `0xe7cd86e13AC4309349F30B3435a9d337750fC82D` | `0xcd6f528fd2E6119C1ec79A7e56ae579A8a554492` |
| AUSD | `0x00000000eFE302BEAA2b3e6e1b18d08D69a9012a` | `0xEB937d6A4faa621bC4Ccf1A13c641e2f9272BE62` |
| LV | `0x1001fF13bf368Aa4fa85F21043648079F00E1001` | `0x21E4d841e4a7E883b8921B3540dF54A5478fe1E4` |
| XAUt0 | `0x01bFF41798a0BcF287b996046Ca68b395DbC1071` | `0x5BAA387e3AA23a489ab3b86dFc8A36336a655077` |

Quote tokens (WMON, LVMON) and registered V2 / graduated V1 tokens are accepted without being on this allowlist.
